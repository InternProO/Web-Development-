Creating a web service to automatically optimize and compress web assets using AI involves several steps. Here’s a simplified example of how you might structure this project using Python with Flask for the web service and TensorFlow for AI-based optimization. The code will cover:

Setting up the Flask web service.
Implementing basic optimization functions.
Integrating an AI model (for example, a pre-trained model for image compression).
This example will focus on image optimization using a pre-trained model. For scripts and stylesheets, you would typically use libraries like csscompressor and jsmin, but AI-based optimization for these is more complex and often involves different approaches.

Step 1: Set Up Flask Web Service
Install necessary packages: pip install flask tensorflow pillow


Step 2: Implement Basic Optimization Functions
In the example above, compress_image is a dummy function to demonstrate the concept. You would replace this with an actual AI-based compression method. For real-world scenarios, you might use a TensorFlow or PyTorch model trained specifically for image compression.

Step 3: AI Model Integration
You would typically integrate a more complex AI model for image compression. For instance, you might use a model trained to compress images while preserving quality. The example uses MobileNetV2 as a placeholder. You’ll need to train or use a pre-trained model suitable for your specific needs.

Running the Service
Save the code to app.py.
Run the Flask app : python app.py

Test the service using tools like Postman or curl by sending a POST request with an image file to http://127.0.0.1:5000/optimize

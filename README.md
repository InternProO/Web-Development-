This Repository contains all the necessary examples which are needed for the candidate to understand what exactly they have to do in their Tasks .


Basic Tasks:

1.)Create a Browser Extension for Visual Web Page Design:
Description: This task involves building a browser extension (for browsers like Chrome or Firefox) that allows users to visually design web pages without writing code. Users can drag and drop elements, adjust layouts, and customize styles directly within the extension.
Implementation Steps:
Set up a basic extension project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Create an interface (e.g., a popup or sidebar) where users can design their web pages visually.
Handle user interactions (e.g., saving designs, exporting HTML/CSS).
Optionally, integrate with existing design libraries or frameworks.

2.)Customizable Template Generator:
Description: In this task, you’ll create a template generator that adapts to user preferences and content types. Users can input specific data (e.g., page title, content) to generate customized templates.
Implementation Steps:
Design a template structure (e.g., HTML, CSS) with placeholders for dynamic content.
Allow users to input their data (e.g., using forms or an interface).
Replace placeholders in the template with actual content.
Provide options for customization (e.g., font styles, color schemes).

3.) Static Site Generator with AI Recommendations:
Description: Building a static site generator involves creating HTML pages from predefined templates. In this case, we’ll enhance it with AI recommendations for optimal layouts based on content and user interactions.
Implementation Steps:
Develop a script (e.g., Python, Node.js) that generates static HTML files.
Use AI algorithms (e.g., clustering, natural language processing) to analyze content.
Recommend layout adjustments (e.g., image placement, font sizes) based on AI insights.

Intermediate Tasks:

1.) Responsive Web Application with ML-Based Design Adaptation:
Description: This task combines responsive design principles with machine learning. You’ll create a web app that dynamically adapts its design based on user behavior (e.g., screen size, interactions).
Implementation Steps:
Choose a front-end framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
Implement responsive design techniques (e.g., media queries).
Integrate ML models (e.g., TensorFlow.js) to adjust UI components (e.g., font sizes, layouts) dynamically.

2.) Real-Time Collaborative Web Editor:
Description: Building a collaborative web editor allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously. Think of it as a live code editor where changes are reflected in real time.
Implementation Steps:
Set up a real-time communication channel (e.g., WebSockets, Firebase).
Sync changes across users’ screens (e.g., text editing, code updates).
Handle conflicts (when two users edit the same content simultaneously).

3.)AR Integration in Web Apps:
Description: Augmented Reality (AR) enhances user experiences by overlaying digital elements on the real world. In this task, you’ll integrate AR features into a web application.
Implementation Steps:
Choose an AR library (e.g., A-Frame, AR.js).
Identify scenarios where AR can enhance user interactions (e.g., product visualization, educational content).
Overlay AR elements (e.g., 3D models, annotations) on web pages.

Advanced Tasks:

1.) Web Service for Asset Optimization:
Description: This task involves creating a web service that automatically optimizes and compresses web assets (images, scripts, stylesheets) using AI techniques. The goal is to improve performance and reduce load times.
Implementation Steps:
Set up a server (e.g., Node.js) to handle asset optimization requests.
Use AI algorithms (e.g., image compression libraries, minification tools) to process assets.
Serve optimized assets to clients.

2.) Unified Interface for Data Visualization (Third-Party APIs):
Description: Build a web application that integrates with multiple third-party APIs to provide a unified interface for complex data visualization and interaction. Users can access various data sources seamlessly.
Implementation Steps:
Identify relevant APIs (e.g., Google Charts, D3.js, financial data APIs).
Create a dashboard or visualization tool that combines data from these sources.
Allow users to customize visualizations and explore data interactively.

3.) Decentralized Web Platform with Blockchain:
Description: In this advanced task, you’ll create a decentralized web platform using blockchain technology. It ensures secure content management and user authentication without relying on central servers.
Implementation Steps:
Choose a blockchain
